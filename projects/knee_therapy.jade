  [Knee Therapy](#) was inspired by a personal knee injury I suffered my senior season of collegiate soccer. Rehab was tough, but so was monitoring my progress. I wanted a place that kept all of my information together and an experience that made my challenges much more tolerable.

  ### The Takeaway

  The close connection I felt to the material of this project propelled me to work hard to get it right. I spent most of my ideation trying to figure out what would help me best in therapy if this was a reality. Essentially, making myself an example of the user allowed for a successful outcome.

      ### Goal

      To create a tracker that clearly **visualizes** all stats kept during rehab for **real-time progress.** Providing a more **enjoyable experience** for the monotonous tasks of log-keeping would alleviate stress and combat discouragement.

      ### Info Architecture

      Knee Therapy breaks down to a comprehensive dashboard of stats taken from both Strength and Conditioning workouts. **Statistics gathered would aggregate from exercise machines used in rehab as well as manual input.**
