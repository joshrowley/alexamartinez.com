      ### Goal

      To empower hoteliers to control their own destiny.

      There is a need to **immerse** users in an intensely visual experience of their hotel as if they were actually there and **capture** the energy and beauty of prime luxury hotels around the world. Essentially we want to **redirect** users to trusted hotel sites for instant booking.
