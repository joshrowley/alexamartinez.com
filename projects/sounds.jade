  ### The Takeaway

  Itâ€™s all of the little things that count. I was  excited to relate to both my roots of New Jersey and love for music in this project. The lessons? Animating according to sound brings unrivaled energy and cohesion. Going the extra mile in animating details elevates the work to a whole new level.
