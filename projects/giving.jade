  ### The Takeaway

  Breaking down the existing UX of the donation process was a heavy task. Once simplified, it was enjoyable to create a better flow. One of the best learning tools was using InVision for the first time to showcase my prototype.

      ### Approach

      The use of compelling and relevant imagery draws users in, illustrating student work. Boiling down the donation form to only the essential steps needed would change user satisfaction greatly.
